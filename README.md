# File-Organizer-Python

Desktop File Organizer Application
This project is a simple desktop application developed as a part of my learning experience to organize files on the desktop into specified folders using Python and PyQt5.

About the Application
The application offers a GUI that allows users to select a directory and then automatically sorts the files from that directory based on predefined categories. The tool provides features such as dynamic renaming to avoid file overwriting and real-time logging to keep track of the moved files.

Technologies Used
Python: The main programming language used to develop the application.
PyQt5: Used to create the graphical user interface.
os & shutil: Python libraries used for file operations.
datetime: Python library used to timestamp logging.
Features
User-friendly Interface: Select source directory and organize files with a click.
Automatic File Sorting: Files are sorted based on their type (e.g., images, PDFs, Python files, etc.).
Dynamic Renaming: In case of name clashes, the application renames files automatically.
Real-time Logging: Every file move is logged with a timestamp.
How to Use
Run the script.
Choose your desired directory.
Click "Organize Files" and watch as the application tidies up your files!
Future Enhancements
While the application currently serves its primary function, there's always room for improvement. Potential enhancements could include:

Adding more file categories.
Introducing user customization for target directories.
Enhancing the GUI for a better user experience.
